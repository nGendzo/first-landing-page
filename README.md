# first-landing-page

This will be my first indepedent work from The Odin Project foundations course. I've learnt how to use unix based operating system, specifically lighter version of Ubuntu, named Xubuntu. Using this OS I got familiar with Terminal and command language - Bash.

I also made my first repository on Github and uploaded first ever project using most popular version control system - Git.

This is my first landing page project ever. I've learnt foundations of HTML and CSS and now I'm able to make small webpages, which can be applied to real-life scenarios.

Whole webpage will be build using flexbox technology.
